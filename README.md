## Abstract
Accurately predicting bugs and defects in software units helps the developers and testers to
find the defective unit and save their efforts in other software developing aspects. Previous studies
used the concept of machine-learning to build models to detect defective units in software. We re-
visited the previous studies and pointed out the areas of potential improvements. The conventional
classifiers give poor results as they perform well in only some part of data, so there is a need of
an advance classifier which is not very complex in implementation and give a decent result. This
study will provide a way to use a popular concept of Mixture of Experts in this domain and will
provide comparison of various variations.
Keywords: Software defect prediction, Machine Learning, Mixture of experts.
