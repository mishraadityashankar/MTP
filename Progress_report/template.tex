%I am highly indebted to {\bf Supervisor name}, and obliged for giving me the autonomy of
%functioning and experimenting with ideas. I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude to him
%not only for his academic guidance but also for his personal interest in my report and constant support coupled with
%confidence boosting and motivating sessions which proved very fruitful and were instrumental in infusing self-assurance
%and trust within me. The nurturing and blossoming of the present work is mainly due to his valuable guidance,
%suggestions, astute judgment, constructive criticism and an eye for perfection. My mentor always answered myriad of my
%doubts with smiling graciousness and prodigious patience, never letting me feel that I am novices by always lending an
%ear to my views, appreciating and improving them and by giving me a free hand in my report. It's only
%because of his overwhelming interest and helpful attitude, the present work has attained the stage it has. \\
